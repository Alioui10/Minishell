# Minishell
This project has been done in may 2023, it was part of my studies in ENSEEIHT, it implements a basic shell (called minishell) that allows users to execute commands, manage background and foreground processes, and use several built-in commands like cd, lj, sj, bg, and fg. The shell can also handle external commands and manage signals like SIGTSTP and SIGINT.
